## Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects pg.106-144
**Three groups of built-in objects**  
As soon as a webpage is loaded, built-in objects are used to help you write your scripts. There are three types:  
**1. Browser Object Model**  
creates a model of the browser tab or window. Top object is *window*  
- some examples: `window.document` - reference to document object.
- `window.history` - contains details of pages that have been viewed in that window/tab
- `window.open()` - this is a method that opens a new browser with URL specified as a parameter.  
**2. Document Object Model**  
creates model of current webpage. Top object is *document*  
ex: `document.write` - writes text to document.  
`document.getElementById()` - returns element if there is an element that has a matching id value.  
**3. Global JavaScript Object**   
group of individual objects that relate to diff parts of JS language. Refer to pgs 128-139. Will be very useful in the future.
