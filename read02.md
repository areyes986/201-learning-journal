- **Superscript** `<sup></sup>`, ex: `Oct. 28<sup>th</sup>` = Oct. 28<sup>th</sup>

- **Line breaks** `<br />`, to add a line break in a `<p>` if you want. 
- **Horizontal Rules** `<hr />` using this adds a horizontal rule.
- line breaks and horizontal rules are *empty elements.*

### Semtantic Markup ###
- text elements that do not affect your webpages structure but adds extra info to pages.
**Strong and Emphasis**
- A question I have about this is, what is the difference between strong and emphasis tags from `<b>` and `<i>`?
**Quotations** 
- `<blockquote>` - used for longer quotes
- `<q>` - shorter quotes that sit in paragraphs. It adds quotations. Not used a lot because it is not supported by Internet Explorer. 
- **Abbreviations and Acronyms** `<abbr>`
- **Citations** `<cite>`for referencing a piece of work
- **Definitions** `<dfn>` for new terminology
- **Author Details** `<address>`, contact info of author, appears italized
- **Changes to Contect**
- `<ins>` - shows what info has been inserted into the doc, it is underlines
- `<del>` - shows text that has been deleted, a line through the word
- `<s>` - used when info is not accurate or relevant, a line through center of word as well.
