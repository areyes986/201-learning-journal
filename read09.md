## Ch. 15, Layout, Specifically, Page Sizes ##
Designers try to create pages that are about 960 - 1000 px wide because screen sizes vary a lot. 

- Designers still try to put as much info at the top of 570-600 px(above the fold)because the designers want the user to know more about what that site is about so it'll have users want to scroll down more. They also hint that there is more info below to get user to scroll down. 

**Fixed Width Layout**  
This stays the same size when user increases/decreases the size of their browser. Measurements are given in px.

**Liquid Layouts**  
These are measured by percentages. They stretch/contract when user increases/decreases their browser. It is good to used `min-width` and `max-width` properties to help your elements from being too long or short.

### Layout Grids ###
Designers use a grid structure that helps them position their page. 960 px grid is widely used among designers. 

- it helps create continuity between pages
- helps users preditct where you find info on pages
- its easier to add new content consistently
- helps collaboration on the design in a consistent way.

### Multiple Style Sheets ###

Some designers use multiple CSS style sheets for different parts of their page such as layout or fonts or colors. You can add different style sheets in two ways:  
1. `@import`
1. `<link>`
